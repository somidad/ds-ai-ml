## Machine learning

### Neural network

- Multi-layer perceptron
	- [Activation function](./Activation%20function.md)
	- Backpropagation
	- Gradient descent
- Learning efficiency
	- Batch gradient descent (using all samples)
	- Stochastic gradient descent (using one samples)
	- Mini-batch gradient descent (compromise)

[Neural network courses](./Neural%20network%20courses.md)

#### Questions

- [ ] How does cost function get modeled/estimated?
- [ ] How does the number of hidden layers and neurons get determined?
